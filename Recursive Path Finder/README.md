For this project the goal was to create a recursive function that
was given a 2D list, a start location, and end location. And find a path between them, as
well as find the shortest path between them. This project was the last project
in my computer science 2 class. It did not take me very long because as soon
as this project was talked about in class when it was open for us to work on, I knew
exactly what kind of algorithm to use. Thanks to my discrete structures 2 class, where 70%
of the course was talking about finding the shortest paths in cycle graphs
as well as how to implement them into python. I had already known about
depth first search, breadth first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. With
knowledge from these, programming them in to fit how the 2D list is read
took a day. This is one of the quicker projects I've done, but it did help
show me that maybe discrete math is important sometimes.
