This project was all on minecraft. Minecraft has a very small 
wiring system called redstone, it can be turned on or off. But
just this alone is simply a 1 or a 0, so you could technically
make a small computer from this. I set out to achieve this with
my liking to minecraft redstone since I was a kid. 

This file contains a minecraft world file to download and see 
my work. The goal was to learn how to store bits, add bits together,
and transfer bit strings over 1 line of redstone. Again like many
projects I've started, this one is still a work in progress. It
should also be important to note, no ideas were taken from online.
Everything in this world was completely made by me. There are quite
a few videos online of people making real finished computers on minecraft,
but what you see here is just a week or two of my understanding and
my idea of how I would make one.

I will also include a description file which contains what each part
of the computer does and anything you will need to know. Also, the
world name may appear as Red Red Blue in Minecraft.
