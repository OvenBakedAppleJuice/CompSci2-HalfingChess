Minecraft Mini Computer description:

Begin at the white blocks section where I lay out what you'll
be seeing as well as understanding of gates and bits.

Once you finish that work your way over to the yellow and pink
blocks structure. There you will see my first understanding of
a binary counter with the lever on the ground. This is connected
to another bit string in which I attempted to add them together 
and never got a finished build.

Moving on to the Blue, green, and yellow structure just past the
binary counter, is my first understanding and challenge to send 
a small bit string through a single line of redstone. This was
also displayed in the white block area with my final version, but
what you are seeing here is my first. Using the three levers to
make a 3 bit string and the button to the left that wraps around
back to the machine will send data to the blue "function" in which
it will read the data and send it back out in the same order. 
Then it will come back to the purple "function" where this reads
the data in the correct order and displays which bits are 1s and 0s.
The yellow "function" is an XOR gate for the bit string but, I'm
not sure if it works anymore.

Moving on to the big structure, the front is where you can see the
manual input of an 8 bit string, as well as a few other buttons.
The first goal was to create storage for these bits. Then spit them
out later for some other use. Following the line to the back of it,
to the darker green section where I store the bits into Barrels.
With swords being 1s and blocks being 0s.
