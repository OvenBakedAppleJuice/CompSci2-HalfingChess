This project was a quick one, I challenge myself one night to create
blackjack. At the time I wasn't super familiar with the correct usage
of classes so all game function run within just the one class. Creating
the stand, hit, double down, and betting functions were easy. As well as getting the AI
to work, the real challenge came when I wanted to start the split function.

The split function became difficult because of the way I had the cards set up, 
as well as the fact that the whole game was built within just one class. 
If I were to redo this project I would have made a class called hand to hold each hand,
 then when a split was called a new hand would be created for that player.

The game works completely fine besides the split function. This project was
written within 2 hours. The process was plan, understand the basic functions
and mechanics of blackjack. Then write the methods. This project
isn't meant to display any of my complex skills but to understand my
process of coding and to see my learning curve.

If you'd like to try it out for yourself, simply run the main file.
