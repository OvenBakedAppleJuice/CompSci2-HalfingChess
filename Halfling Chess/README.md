This was the big project in Computer Science 2 at GVSU, the goal
was to create a game similar to Chess and DnD.
This project was focused around building classes, abstract classes, and inheritance.

This was all done in October, and along with every project in Comp Sci 2
there must be a unittest file along with it. As well as a report to what I learned in this project.
This project was also completed with the help of some other students in the class, though it was all coded by me, 
many ideas where shared amongst a group. If a problem occurred on one person's end, and another had the solution we
could communicate ideas without just duplicating the code (since our code was different in many ways anyway).

This file has the game file that contains the running functions of the game. This file should
be run to start the game, the game will be displayed in the Console. The file
also contains the creatures, dungeon, coord, character, and test_game scripts. 
The creatures file contains all the classes that define their methods and/or any 
abstract methods from their parent(s). The dungeon file contains all the methods that run
the characters actions on the board. The coord file holds a simple class that holds an x and y value.
The character file holds the main abstract class the defines all child actions.
And finally the unittest file to ensure all our code works properly.
